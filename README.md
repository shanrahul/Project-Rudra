# Project-Rudra
It's a micro-controller based solar night light system. I have used arduino nano for this project and
i have attach the relavant code and libraries for this project.

The new Project Rudra have updated to PCB board and have more other features as well.

Before you run the code , you should download the libraries and add them inside the libraries folder of arduino.
Then you can easily compile and upload the code.
